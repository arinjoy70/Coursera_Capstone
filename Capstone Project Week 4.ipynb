    "In this project, we will try to find the best location or neighborhood for a new hotel. Specifically, this report will be targeted to potential investors and other relevant stakeholders who are interested in opening a hotel in Toronto, Canada.\n",

    "There are a lot of hotels in Toronto so we are looking for areas that are not concentrated with hotels and also the neighborhoods that has the most tourist spots. We have to look at locations that restaurants too but not too many because our hotel will have a restaurant too so we need a nice balance between giving our customers a choice as well promoting our restaurant services. We would also look if the location is nearby to the airport on the basis that it will be easier for tourists to come to if they are new and unfamiliar to Toronto. But this would not be the most important factor we will be looking at, and will be considered if the other criterias are met and we need to choose between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage our statisical tools to find suitable locations and investigate the above criterias. This will in turn potentially maximise business for the hotel and in each case we will explain why it is suitable for the stakeholders to choose from."
